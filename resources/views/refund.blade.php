                <p data-mce-fragment="1">Consumers that receive a refund must discard any previously delivered ticket(s) and not use it to attend events for which the ticket is issued. Violating this constitutes fraud. Organisers are expected to follow all applicable procedures to verify the validity of tickets. Sell-Fisrt will not be held liable for any costs arising from a failure by Organisers to check validity of tickets or for any costs and damages arising from fraud or purchase of tickets via non-official means.</p>
                <p data-mce-fragment="1">Before purchasing tickets, it is the Consumer’s responsibility to carefully review all aspects of events covered by such tickets, including event restriction, dates, pricing, and charges. Sell-Fisrt will not issue any refunds for any lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged tickets, or as under any other circumstances except in the limited cases explicitly described in this Agreement. If Sell-Fisrt terminates a subscription ticket, the Consumer must immediately stop using such ticket and/or attending events covered by such ticket. However, if the Consumer has subscribed to and paid for a subscription ticket, and Sell-Fisrt and/or Organiser terminate or cancel such ticket before the end of a paid subscription period, or Sell-Fisrt terminates Consumers account before the end of a paid subscription period for reasons other than Consumers breach of these Terms, Sell-Fisrt will refund a prorated portion of the applicable subscription fee corresponding to the portion of the paid subscription period for which our action caused Consumer not to have access to the events covered by the subscription ticket. If Sell-Fisrt terminate or cancel Consumers subscription ticket because Consumer breached these Terms, Consumer will not be entitled to any refund.</p>
                <p data-mce-fragment="1">Even if a refund is issued by Organiser, Sell-Fisrt’s Fees will be deducted from the refund amount, regardless of whether the fee is included or excluded from the ticket price. The Consumer may apply for a refund prior to the event in question provided that tickets for the event remain on sale. The Consumer may apply for a refund of a subscription ticket prior to the beginning of the subscription period provided that the subscription tickets remain on sale. Acceptance of refunds is determined by the Organisers refund policy and it is the Consumers responsibility to check this policy with the Organiser prior to purchasing any ticket.&nbsp;</p>
                <h1 data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"></h1>
                <p data-mce-fragment="1">Should an event be cancelled, the Organiser of the event will inform the User prior to such cancellation and will refund to the User the ticket price minus the Sell-Fisrt Fee. However, for subscription tickets cancellation of one or more events covered by such ticket will not entitle the Consumer to a refund of the subscription fee or any part thereof. The Organiser of an event covered by a subscription ticket will inform the Consumer prior to any cancellation or change of the events coved by such ticket.&nbsp;</p>
                <p data-mce-fragment="1">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms any and all claims for refunds become obsolete three (3) years from the time where such claim arose.</p>
